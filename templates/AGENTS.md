# AGENTS.md

This file defines a minimal, repo-local contract for coding agents.

## Prime Directive

Act → Verify → Land

- If you changed code, you must verify it with the repo’s quality gates.
- If it verifies, you must commit it.
- If it’s ready, open a PR.

## Canonical Quality Gates (order)

typecheck → lint → test → build
